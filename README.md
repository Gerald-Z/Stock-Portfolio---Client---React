# Stock-Portfolio Tracker - Client 

## Description: 
The application creates a multi-page website that allows users to create an account and keep track of a list of stock portfolios. 

This application is produced using HTML, CSS, and React.js, the latter of which was bootstraped by [Create React App]. The different pages of the website were implemented as different React components that were displayed depending on
different scenarios by React Routers. 

Data regarding the users, including both their account credentials and their portfolios, are stored on the server of this project. When authentication is needed, or when the client needs to display the user's portfolio, 
API requests are sent to the server(s) of the project.

Finally, the E2E testing of the website was done via Cypress. 




## Some Challenges I encountered: 





## Plans for the future: 
As of August 29, 2023, the website is still not complete. There are a lot of stylings that can be added, and additional functions can be added.
